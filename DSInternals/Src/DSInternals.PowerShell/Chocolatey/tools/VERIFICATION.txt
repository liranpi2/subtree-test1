VERIFICATION

This is the official DSInternals PowerShell Module Chocolatey package.

The package is self-contained and contains the same files as the GitHub ZIP release (https://github.com/MichaelGrafnetter/DSInternals/releases).

File integrity can be checked against the catalog file using the following PowerShell 5 command:

Test-FileCatalog -CatalogFilePath tools\DSInternals.cat -Path DSInternals -Detailed

Note that the catalog file is not digitally signed (for now).
